        <h1>The confusing world of dental care</h1>

        <p>In a world where we are constantly bombarded by facts, half-facts, and downright myths – like “non-fluoride toothpaste is better for your teeth” or “you must rinse with mouthwash to kill bacteria” – it is no wonder we feel lost.</p>

        <p>Your overall health is reflected by the state of your mouth. Bleeding gums are a sign of inflammation, and frequent bad breath or sensitivity can hint at deeper issues. These signs should not be ignored. (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ijos201239" target="_blank">study</a>)</p>

        <p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Holistic-Dental-Care-Whole-Body-Approach/dp/1556439419" target="_blank">Nadine Artemis’ book Holistic Dental Care</a> and current scientific studies, this confusing world of dental advice can be simplified into seven clear, effective steps – creating a holistic routine.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>OIL PULLING</h2>
                Oil pulling is an Ayurvedic practice where you swish a small amount of oil (preferably cold-pressed organic coconut oil) in your mouth for around 5-15 minutes. 
                A <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9602184/" target="_blank">meta-analysis</a> concluded it significantly reduces total bacterial counts. Including this at the start of your morning may help with bad breath, plaque, and mild gum inflammation.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>SALT RINSE</h2>
                The enamel on your teeth is primarily made of hydroxyapatite, which is susceptible to acid dissolution when your mouth’s pH drops below 5.5.

                <p>A saltwater rinse helps raise saliva pH, reducing the risk of enamel softening – especially helpful if you brush right after eating.</p>

                <p>Mix at home:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>300 mL natural spring water</li>
                    <li>6 grams salt</li>
                    <li>1 drop peppermint oil</li>
                    <li>1 drop frankincense oil</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>TONGUE SCRAPING</h2>
                Another practice from Ayurveda, often with a copper scraper. Randomized trials <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17004573/" target="_blank">show</a> it reduces volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) – the main cause of bad breath – better than brushing your tongue.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>BRUSHING GUMS</h2>
                Brushing the gums toward the teeth stimulates blood flow and keeps gum tissue resilient. Like <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/dry-brushing" target="_blank">dry brushing skin</a> is thought to boost circulation.

                <p>Holistic practitioners (including Nadine Artemis) and mainstream dentists agree: brush along the gum line to disrupt plaque where it builds up first.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>BRUSHING TEETH</h2>
                Powered toothbrushes consistently outperform manual brushing. 
                <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/idh.12563" target="_blank">Studies show</a> they remove more plaque and reduce gum inflammation.

                <p>Unlike Nadine Artemis’ preference for non-fluoride options, decades of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30829399/" target="_blank">research</a> prove fluoride toothpaste is the most effective way to prevent cavities.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>FLOSS, PICK, OR WHATEVER SUITS YOU</h2>
                Whether traditional floss, water flossers, or soft picks — what matters is cleaning between teeth daily, where most cavities and gum issues begin.
            </li>

            
            <li>
                <h2>SALT RINSES</h2>
                Finish with a gentle salt rinse to soothe gums, balance pH, and wash away lingering acids.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>WHAT TO AVOID?</h1>
        <p>Not everything on the store shelf is a friend to your mouth.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alcohol-based mouthwashes can reduce bacteria short-term, but <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8041073/" target="_blank">studies</a> show no meaningful difference vs. alcohol-free. Alcohol-free is often gentler.</li>
            <li>Common toothpaste additives to consider avoiding (inspired by <a href="https://int.livinglibations.com/pages/may-be-harmful-if-swallowed" target="_blank">Nadine Artemis’ philosophy</a>):
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS)</strong>: linked to gum irritation & mouth ulcers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Artificial colours, sweeteners, or preservatives</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25231862/" target="_blank">research suggests</a> they may impact the oral or gut microbiome.</li>
                    <li><strong>Triclosan</strong>: once common for plaque control, now largely phased out over safety concerns.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>BOTTOM LINE</h1>
        <p>Your mouth is the gateway to your body – caring for it doesn’t have to be complicated. Combining holistic practices with solid science helps you build a ritual that feels good, nurtures your mouth, and supports lifelong health.</p>
