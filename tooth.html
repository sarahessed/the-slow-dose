        <h1>The confusing world of dental care</h1>

        <p>In a world where we are constantly bombarded by facts, half-facts, and downright myths – like “non-fluoride toothpaste is better for your teeth” or “you must rinse with mouthwash to kill bacteria” – it is no wonder we feel lost.</p>

        <p>Your overall health is reflected by the state of your mouth. Bleeding gums are a sign of inflammation, and frequent bad breath or sensitivity can hint at deeper issues. These signs should not be ignored.</p>

        <p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Holistic-Dental-Care-Whole-Body-Approach/dp/1556439419" target="_blank">Nadine Artemis’ book Holistic Dental Care</a>, and current scientific studies, this confusing world of dental advice can be simplified into seven clear, effective steps – creating a holistic routine.</p>

        <h2>Oil pulling</h2>
        <p>Oil pulling is an Ayurvedic practice where you swish a small amount of oil (preferably cold-pressed organic coconut oil) in your mouth for around 5-15 minutes. 
        A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26708389/" target="_blank">meta-analysis</a> concluded that oil pulling significantly reduces total bacterial counts in the mouth. 
        Including this step at the very start of your morning routine may help with bad breath, plaque levels, and mild gum inflammation.</p>

        <h2>Salt rinse</h2>
        <p>The enamel on your teeth is primarily made of hydroxyapatite, a crystalline calcium phosphate that’s susceptible to acid dissolution (demineralization) when your mouth’s pH drops below 5.5.</p>
        <p>A saltwater rinse is a mildly alkaline solution, helping to slightly raise saliva pH away from acidity, reducing the risk of enamel softening – especially helpful if you brush right after eating, when enamel is at its most fragile.</p>
        <p>You can easily mix up a salt rinse at home:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>300 mL of natural spring water</li>
            <li>6 grams of salt</li>
            <li>1 drop of peppermint oil (for freshness)</li>
            <li>1 drop of frankincense oil (anti-inflammatory)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tongue scraping</h2>
        <p>Another practice rooted in Ayurveda is tongue scraping, often done with a copper scraper, since copper has mild antimicrobial properties.
        Randomized trials have shown that tongue scraping significantly reduces volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) – the primary cause of bad breath – and does so far more effectively than brushing the tongue with a toothbrush.</p>

        <h2>Brushing gums</h2>
        <p>Carefully brushing the gums toward the teeth stimulates blood flow, which helps keep gum tissue resilient and supports healing – much like how dry brushing the skin is believed to boost circulation.</p>
        <p>Many holistic practitioners, including Nadine Artemis, emphasize gentle gum brushing as a way to strengthen the entire mouth. And mainstream dentists agree: brushing along the gum line is essential for disrupting plaque where it tends to build up first.</p>

        <h2>Brushing teeth</h2>
        <p>When it comes to plaque and gum health, powered (mechanical) toothbrushes consistently outperform manual brushing. 
        Studies show they remove plaque and reduce gum inflammation, making them especially helpful for anyone prone to gingivitis – simply inflammation of the gums.</p>
        <p>Unlike Nadine Artemis’ holistic preference for non-fluoride options, decades of high-quality research demonstrate that fluoride toothpaste remains the single most effective way to prevent cavities. It works topically to strengthen enamel and protects against acid attacks.</p>

        <h2>Floss, pick, or whatever suits you</h2>
        <p>Whether you prefer traditional floss, water flossers, or soft picks, what matters is cleaning between the teeth every day. This is where most cavities and gum issues begin.</p>

        <h2>Salt rinse (again)</h2>
        <p>Finishing your routine with a gentle salt rinse helps soothe the gums, balance your mouth’s pH, and wash away lingering acids. It is a simple way to leave your mouth feeling calm and refreshed.</p>

        <h2>What to avoid?</h2>
        <p>Not everything on the store shelf is a friend to your mouth.</p>
        <p>Alcohol-based mouthwashes can help reduce bacteria in the short-term, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6343334/" target="_blank">studies</a> show that there is no meaningful difference between alcohol-based and alcohol-free rinses. For most people, alcohol-free options are the gentler choice, especially since alcohol is more likely to cause irritation and dryness.</p>
        <p>Common toothpaste additives are also worth a closer look. Inspired by Nadine Artemis’ philosophy, many people choose to avoid ingredients such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS)</strong>: a foaming agent linked to gum irritation and more frequent mouth ulcers.</li>
            <li><strong>Artificial colours, sweeteners, or preservatives</strong>: emerging research suggests they could impact the oral or gut microbiome.</li>
            <li><strong>Triclosan</strong>: once widely used for plaque control, but now largely phased out due to safety concerns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Simply being aware of these ingredients helps you make more informed choices about the products you bring into your routine.</p>

        <h2>Bottom line</h2>
        <p>In the end, your mouth is the gateway to your body – and caring for it does not have to be complicated.</p>
        <p>By combining holistic practices with solid science, you can create a dental care ritual that feels good, nurtures your mouth, and supports lifelong health.</p>
