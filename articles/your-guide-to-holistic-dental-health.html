    <h1>YOUR GUIDE TO HOLISTIC DENTAL HEALTH</h1>

    <p>25-12-25</p>
    <p>
      Taking care of your teeth is essential. Yet with so many sources of information, it can be difficult to know what is right — if there even is one right way. Inspired by Nadine Artemis’ book <em>Holistic Dental Care</em>, combined with scientific evidence, a holistic dental routine can be created.

      <h1>OIL PULLING</h1>

      <p>
        An ancient Ayurvedic practice in which a small amount of oil (preferably cold-pressed, organic coconut oil) is swished around the mouth for about 5–10 minutes and then spit out. The oil binds to bacteria, helping to reduce bad breath and plaque levels.

    <section>
      <h1>SALT RINSE</h1>

      <p>
        After eating, the pH in your mouth naturally drops. If you brush your teeth too soon, this acidic environment can damage your enamel. Rinsing your mouth with a salt solution helps raise the pH away from acidity, reducing the risk of enamel softening.
      </p>
      
      <p>You can easily prepare a salt rinse at home:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>300 mL natural spring water</li>
        <li>6 g salt</li>
        <li>1 drop peppermint oil (for freshness)</li>
        <li>1 drop frankincense oil (anti-inflammatory)</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h1>TONGUE SCRAPING</h1>

      <p>
        Another practice rooted in Ayurveda is tongue scraping, traditionally done with a copper scraper due to copper’s mild antimicrobial properties. Removing buildup from the tongue helps reduce bad breath.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>BRUSHING GUMS</h1>

      <p>
        Gently brushing the gums toward the teeth stimulates blood flow. This supports resilient gum tissue and promotes healing, similar to how dry brushing the skin is believed to enhance circulation.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>BRUSHING TEETH</h1>

      <p>
        When it comes to plaque removal and gum health, powered (mechanical) toothbrushes consistently outperform manual brushing. As for toothpaste, fluoride toothpaste remains the most effective option for preventing cavities.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>FLOSS, PICK, OR WHATEVER SUITS YOU</h1>

      <p>
        Whether you prefer traditional floss, water flossers, or soft picks, the key is cleaning between the teeth daily. This is where most cavities and gum issues begin.

    <section>
      <h1>SALT RINSE</h1>

      <p>
        Finishing your routine with a gentle salt rinse helps soothe the gums, rebalance your mouth’s pH, and wash away lingering acids. A simple way to leave your mouth feeling calm and refreshed.
      </p>

    <h1>BOTTOM LINE</h1>

    <p>
      The most important thing is having a routine and staying consistent with it. Always discuss your dental care routine with your dentist — they are the professional, after all.
