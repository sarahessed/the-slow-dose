    <h1>SUSTAINABLE WELLNESS CHOICES</h1>

    25-01-2026
    
    <p>
      Wellness does not need to be complicated. Small, repeatable practices that support
      the body’s natural processes tend to be the most sustainable.
    </p>

    <p>
      For me, a daily routine is not about optimisation, but about creating enough support
      for the body to do what it already knows how to do. Below are a few tools I return to
      regularly.
    </p>

      <h1>DRY BRUSHING</h1>

      <p>
        The skin is the largest organ of the body and plays an active role in detoxification
        and circulation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dry brushing before showering helps remove dead skin cells and gently stimulates
        lymphatic flow. Brushing is done on dry skin, always moving toward the heart.
        The pressure should be light. With consistency, the skin tends to feel smoother
        over time.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>CUPPING</h1>

      <p>
        Cupping is another way to stimulate circulation, particularly in areas where tissue
        tends to feel tight.
      </p>

      <p>
        When done in the shower with soap or oil, the cup creates suction and lifts the skin
        as it moves. It can feel uncomfortable at first, but the sensation usually softens
        with regular use. Many people use cupping to support lymph flow and reduce the
        appearance of cellulite by encouraging movement in connective tissue.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>VIBRATION PLATE</h1>

      <p>
        Movement is essential for lymphatic circulation. Unlike the cardiovascular system,
        the lymphatic system does not have a pump and relies on muscle contraction and motion.
      </p>

      <p>
        A vibration plate mimics the effect of gentle jumping. Short sessions can help wake
        up the body and introduce movement first thing in the morning. It can also help
        signal the nervous system that the day has started.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>RED LIGHT</h1>

      <p>
        Red light therapy uses specific wavelengths of light that penetrate the skin and
        interact with cells.
      </p>

      <p>
        Research suggests it may support mitochondrial function, muscle relaxation, and
        skin quality. It is a passive practice, which makes it easy to integrate without
        overstimulation.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>MOUTH TAPING</h1>

      <p>
        Mouth taping at night is a simple way to encourage nasal breathing during sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        Breathing through the nose helps regulate airflow, humidity, and oxygen uptake.
        For some people, this can improve sleep quality and reduce morning dryness or
        restlessness.

    <h1>BOTTOM LINE</h1>

    <p>
      Sustainable wellness is less about adding more, and more about choosing what genuinely
      supports the body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Simple practices, repeated consistently, tend to matter more than intensity. When a
      routine feels supportive rather than demanding, it becomes much easier to maintain
      over time.
