    <h1>NON-TOXIC SWAPS</h1>
  17-01-2026

    <p>
      Toxins are part of modern life. They are inside, outside, in the air, in materials,
      in products we use every day. Trying to avoid everything is neither realistic nor
      necessary. The body is built to deal with exposure.
    </p>

    <p>
      For me, non-toxic living is not about elimination, but reduction. Choosing a few simple
      swaps that lower the load, without adding stress or rules. Below are some changes that
      feel easy and realistic to maintain.
    </p>

      <h1>LEAF RAZOR</h1>

      <p>
        Most disposable razors are made largely from plastic. The cartridges need frequent
        replacing, and many come with lubricating strips that contain synthetic ingredients.
      </p>

      <p>
        The leaf razor is fully stainless steel. Only the blades need to be replaced.
        There is no plastic, no coating, no added shaving soap. Stainless steel is durable,
        easy to clean, and made to last. It is a small swap, but one that removes both waste
        and unnecessary additives.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>DIATOMACEOUS EARTH BATH MAT</h1>

      <p>
        Regular bath mats stay damp for hours, sometimes days. Over time, they start to smell
        or grow mould.
      </p>

      <p>
        Diatomaceous earth is a mineral formed from fossilised algae. It absorbs moisture almost
        instantly and dries just as quickly. Because it does not stay wet, it is naturally
        resistant to bacteria and mould.
      </p>

      <h1>WOODEN KITCHEN UTENSILS</h1>

      <p>
        Plastic kitchen tools are often exposed to heat. Over time, they wear down and can release
        microplastics into food.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wood is stable, does not melt, and has natural antibacterial properties. Wooden spoons,
        spatulas, and cutting boards feel simple and functional. They last well when cared for and
        remove one more source of daily plastic contact.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>STAINLESS STEEL PANS</h1>

      <p>
        Non-stick coatings often contain PFAS compounds. These are difficult to break down and tend
        to accumulate over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stainless steel takes a bit of practice. Once you understand preheating, it becomes very
        easy to cook with. It handles high heat well and does not rely on coatings.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>CLEANING SUPPLIES</h1>

      <p>
        Many cleaning products aim for sterility. Strong scents, harsh chemicals, and aggressive
        formulas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of the time, that level of cleaning is unnecessary. Simple ingredients like baking
        soda, vinegar, citric acid, and a few drops of essential oil clean effectively without
        overwhelming the indoor environment. The goal is not to eliminate all microbes, but to keep
        things balanced.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>NATURAL FIBRES</h1>

      <p>
        Synthetic fabrics are everywhere. They shed microplastics and sit directly on the skin for hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        Natural fibres tend to breathe better and age more gracefully. Organic cotton, linen, hemp, wool,
        and silk are materials I naturally gravitate towards. For sportswear, merino wool or organic cotton
        works surprisingly well, without the need for synthetic finishes.

    <section>
      <h1>DRINKING BOTTLES</h1>

      <p>
        Plastic bottles are used repeatedly and often exposed to heat, friction, and sunlight.
      </p>

      <p>
        A stainless steel bottle is durable, inert, and easy to carry. Because water is consumed throughout
        the day, this swap reduces constant, low-level plastic exposure.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>GLASS STORAGE CONTAINERS</h1>

      <p>
        Plastic containers scratch over time and can leach compounds, especially when heated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Glass does not absorb smells, colours, or residues. Using glass for leftovers, storage, and reheating
        keeps food simple and unchanged by its container.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>BEESWAX WRAPS</h1>

      <p>
        Beeswax wraps replace plastic wrap and aluminium foil. They are made from cotton coated in beeswax.
      </p>

      <p>
        With warmth, they soften and mould around food or bowls. They can be washed, reused, and eventually composted.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h1>BOTTOM LINE</h1>

    <p>
      Non-toxic living does not have to be extreme. It is about noticing patterns and making small adjustments where
      they make sense.
    </p>

    <p>
      A few consistent choices, repeated daily, matter more than perfect avoidance.
