        <h1>THE OMEGA STORY</h1>

        <p>Omega 3. Omega 6. EPA. DHA. Wild-caught. Farmed.</p>

        <p>We have all heard “omega 3 is good for you” – but which one? How much? And from where?
        If you eat fish, you might assume that you are covered. But not all fish are created equal.
        Many people do not eat enough fish at all. And what if you do not eat fish in the first place?</p>

        <p>This is where supplementation comes in – a convenient, consistent way to get the fats your body needs.
        The trick is knowing what actually matters.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>OMEGA 3 VS. OMEGA 6: THE BALANCE</h2>
            <p>Both omega 3 and 6 are <strong>essential fatty acids</strong> – meaning our bodies cannot make them; we have to get them from food.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Omega 6</strong> is found in vegetable oils (soy, sunflower, corn), processed foods, and grain-fed meat.</li>
                <li><strong>Omega 3</strong> is found in fatty fish, grass-fed meat, flaxseeds, walnuts, and algae.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The problem:</strong><br/>
            Modern diets are very high in omega 6 and low in omega 3. The ideal ratio is thought to be somewhere around <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12442909/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>1:1 to 1:5</strong></a> (omega 3 to omega 6). Today, many people are closer to <strong>1:15 or higher</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Why does this matter?</strong><br/>
            Both fats use the same enzymes in your body. If omega 6 dominates, omega 3 cannot do its job – which means less anti-inflammatory, heart‑healthy, brain‑supportive action.</p>

            <p><em>Tip:</em> Wild-caught fish and grass-fed meat naturally have a lower omega 6 content and a better balance than grain-fed or farmed options.</p>

            <h2>MEASURING YOUR LEVELS</h2>
            <p>Can you guess your omega 3 status? Not accurately.</p>
            <p>The most reliable way is through a simple <strong>Omega‑3 Index</strong> test – a finger-prick blood test that measures the percentage of EPA + DHA in your red blood cells. It can also show your omega 3:6 ratio. This gives you a clear picture of whether supplementation is needed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>ALA, EPA &amp; DHA</h2>
            <p>Omega 3 is not just one fat – there are three main types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ALA</strong> (alpha‑linolenic acid) – found in flaxseeds, chia, walnuts. Your body can convert a small amount into EPA and DHA, but this process is inefficient.</li>
                <li><strong>EPA</strong> (eicosapentaenoic acid) – found in fatty fish, krill and algae; supports heart health and helps reduce inflammation.</li>
                <li><strong>DHA</strong> (docosahexaenoic acid) – found in fatty fish and algae; crucial for brain, eyes, and nerve function.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because conversion from ALA is limited, it is wise to get EPA + DHA directly from diet or supplements.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>SUPPLEMENT QUALITY: WHAT TO LOOK FOR</h2>
            <p>Not all omega 3 capsules are equal. Key things to check:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low oxidation (Totox value)</strong> – the lower, the fresher
                    (<a href="https://www.argalys.com/en/blogs/advices/the-quality-of-omega-3-totox-index-and-other-criteria" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn more</a>).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Added vitamin E (tocopherols)</strong> – helps keep the oil stable.</li>
                <li><strong>Purity</strong> – fish can accumulate heavy metals and toxins. High-quality brands purify their oil.</li>
                <li><strong>Source</strong> – wild-caught small fish like sardines and anchovies tend to be <a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/recommendations/download-consumer-guides/sardine-anchovy-herring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleaner and more sustainable</a>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>EPA:DHA ratio</strong> – anything between <strong>1:1 and 3:2</strong> is common and well-studied
                    (<a href="https://womensmentalhealth.org/posts/omega-3-fatty-acids-the-basics-for-clinicians-and-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overview</a>).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Look for sustainability seals like <strong>MSC</strong> or <strong>Friends of the Sea</strong> to ensure responsible sourcing.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>KRILL &amp; MICROALGAE</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Krill oil</strong> – a source of EPA and DHA. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590157524007685" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 meta-analysis</a> found krill oil supplementation led to greater increases in blood omega‑3 levels compared to fish oil at the same dose.
                    Krill are also low on the food chain, meaning lower risk of heavy‑metal contamination.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Microalgae oil</strong> – a vegan, sustainable source of DHA. Especially useful for those who do not eat fish.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <h1>BOTTOM LINE</h1>
        <p>Omega 3 is one of the most researched nutrients in the world – and one most people do not get enough of.</p>
        <p>Keep your omega 6 intake in check, eat fatty fish or algae regularly, and choose a high‑quality supplement if needed.</p>
