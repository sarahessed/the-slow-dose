        <h1>SKINCARE, LESS IS MORE</h1>

        <p>The skincare world is one of the most confusing fields out there. A mixture of actives, exfoliants, serums, acids now shape what we define as “taking care of our skin”. Some products work miracles for one person and do nothing for another. Experts, influencers, dermatologists, doctors, and naturopaths all seem to say something different.</p>

        <p>So how do we navigate this chaos? And… do we even need to?</p>

        <p>Going back to our ancestors might be a helpful place to start. Ancient skincare was not about trends – it was about nourishment, ritual and balance. Maybe it still can be.</p>

                <h2>HISTORY: OIL AS A MEDICINE</h2>
                Skincare is not a modern invention – humans have been tending to their skin for millennia:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.kosterina.com/blogs/news/olive-oil-for-skin-a-long-rich-history" target="_blank">Ancient Greece & Rome</a>: Olive oil was used in daily bathing rituals, applied to the skin and gently scraped off with a strigil (a curved metal tool).</li>
                    <li>Ancient Egypt: Castor, olive, and sesame oil were prized for their moisturizing and healing properties.</li>
                    <li>Ayurvedic India: Oil cleansing (known as abhyanga) was part of a daily ritual believed to balance the doshas and promote detoxification.</li>
                </ul>
                In all these cultures, plant oils were the foundation – not foaming cleansers or harsh peels.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>CLEANSING: OIL VS. SURFACTANT</h2>
                We have been taught that in order to clean the skin, we need foam. But that squeaky clean feeling? It is not your skin being “pure” – it is your skin barrier being stripped.

                <p>Surfactants (soap-like molecules) do not just remove dirt – they remove your natural oils and disrupt your skin microbiome, which can lead to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354511184_The_effect_of_Cleansers_on_the_Skin_Microbiome" target="_blank">inflammation, dryness, itching, increased sensitivity or breakouts</a>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>WHY OIL WORKS</h2>
                From a physiological view: like dissolves like. Oil breaks down oil-based impurities without damaging your skin barrier. But the type of oil matters:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</strong>: Great for dry or sensitive skin. Rich in oleic acid, vitamin E and antioxidants. May feel heavy for some.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jojoba Oil</strong>: Mimics sebum, suitable for all skin types. Balancing and non-comedogenic. Long shelf life.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://dutchhealthstore.com/how-to-choose-the-perfect-living-libations-best-skin-ever-for-you/" target="_blank">Best Skin Ever Oils</a></strong>: Botanical blends designed for specific needs – calming, clarifying, nourishing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>HOW TO OIL CLEANSE</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wet a soft cloth or cotton round</li>
                    <li>Add 1–2 pumps of oil</li>
                    <li>Massage slowly across the face, especially around clogged areas</li>
                    <li>Wipe off gently</li>
                    <li>Repeat if needed (e.g. makeup or SPF)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>MOISTURISING: KEEP IT SIMPLE</h2>
                Your skin should not feel tight or squeaky after cleansing. If it does, it is crying for balance. A few extra pumps of oil is often all you need. That’s it. No serum stack required.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>ADJUSTMENT PERIOD</h2>
                When switching to oil cleansing, you might notice breakouts, flakiness or temporary oiliness. This is your microbiome recalibrating and your barrier healing. Trust the process – it usually settles within 2–4 weeks.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>SUN</h2>
                We’ve gone from sun worship to SPF fear. A middle path:
                <ul>
                    <li>Seek shade mid-day</li>
                    <li>Cover up if needed</li>
                    <li>For light exposure, antioxidant-rich oils like raspberry seed or carrot seed may help <a href="https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1289&context=jscas" target="_blank">[study]</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> these oils are <em>not</em> SPF replacements. Use non-nano zinc oxide for safe, physical UVA/UVB protection. <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/mineral-vs-chemical-sunscreen" target="_blank">Read more</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>BOTTOM LINE</h1>
        <p>A quality oil will take you much further than a dozen expensive products. Ditch the harsh chemicals and constant layering — come back to less.</p>
