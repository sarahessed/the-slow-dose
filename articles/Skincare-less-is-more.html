    <h1>SKINCARE, LESS IS MORE</h1>

    <p>The skincare world is one of the most confusing fields out there. A mixture of actives, exfoliants, serums, acids now shape what we define as “taking care of our skin”. Some products work miracles for one person and do nothing for another. Experts, influencers, dermatologists, doctors, and naturopaths all seem to say something different.</p>

    <p>So how do we navigate this chaos? And… do we even need to?</p>

    <p>Going back to our ancestors might be a helpful place to start. Ancient skincare was not about trends – it was about nourishment, ritual and balance. Maybe it still can be.</p>

        <li>
            <h2>HISTORY: OIL AS A MEDICINE</h2>
            <p>Skincare is not a modern invention – humans have been tending to their skin for millennia:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.kosterina.com/blogs/news/olive-oil-for-skin-a-long-rich-history" target="_blank">Ancient Greece & Rome</a>: Olive oil was used in daily bathing rituals, applied to the skin and gently scraped off with a strigil.</li>
                <li>Ancient Egypt: Castor, olive, and sesame oil were prized for their moisturizing and healing properties.</li>
                <li>Ayurvedic India: Oil cleansing (abhyanga) was a daily ritual to balance the doshas and promote detoxification.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In all these cultures, plant oils were the foundation – not foaming cleansers or harsh peels.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>CLEANSING: OIL VS. SURFACTANT</h2>
            <p>We’ve been taught that clean skin means foam. But that squeaky clean feeling? That’s your skin barrier being stripped.</p>
            <p>Surfactants (soap-like molecules) remove not just dirt but also natural oils — disrupting your skin microbiome and potentially causing irritation. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354511184_The_effect_of_Cleansers_on_the_Skin_Microbiome" target="_blank">Study link</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>WHY OIL WORKS</h2>
            <p>Like dissolves like. Oil breaks down oil-based impurities without damaging your skin barrier. But the type of oil matters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</strong>: Great for dry or sensitive skin. Rich in oleic acid, vitamin E and antioxidants. May feel heavy for some.</li>
                <li><strong>Jojoba Oil</strong>: Mimics sebum, suitable for all skin types. Balancing and non-comedogenic. Long shelf life.</li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://dutchhealthstore.com/how-to-choose-the-perfect-living-libations-best-skin-ever-for-you/" target="_blank">Best Skin Ever Oils</a></strong>: Botanical blends designed for specific needs – calming, clarifying, nourishing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>HOW TO OIL CLEANSE</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Wet a soft cloth or cotton round</li>
                <li>Add 1–2 pumps of oil</li>
                <li>Massage slowly across the face, especially around clogged areas</li>
                <li>Wipe off gently</li>
                <li>Repeat if needed (e.g. makeup or SPF)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>MOISTURISING: KEEP IT SIMPLE</h2>
            <p>If your skin feels tight after cleansing, it’s unbalanced. A few drops of oil post-cleanse is often enough. No serum stack required.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>ADJUSTMENT PERIOD</h2>
            <p>When switching to oil cleansing, expect possible “detox” reactions like breakouts or flakiness. It’s your skin adjusting and healing. Give it 2–4 weeks.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>SUN</h2>
            <p>We’ve gone from sun worship to SPF fear. Consider a middle path:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Seek shade mid-day</li>
                <li>Cover up if needed</li>
                <li>For light exposure, oils like raspberry seed or carrot seed may help <a href="https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1289&context=jscas" target="_blank">[source]</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: these oils are <strong>not</strong> replacements for SPF. Use non-nano zinc oxide for proper protection. <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/mineral-vs-chemical-sunscreen" target="_blank">Read more</a>.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>BOTTOM LINE</h1>
    <p>A quality oil can do more for your skin than a whole shelf of serums and foams. Less is more. Trust your skin’s natural rhythm.</p>
