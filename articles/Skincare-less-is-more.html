    <h1>SKINCARE, LESS IS MORE</h1>

    <p>The skincare world is one of the most confusing fields out there. A mixture of actives, exfoliants, serums, acids now shape what we define as “taking care of our skin”. Some products work miracles for one person and do nothing for another. Experts, influencers, dermatologists, doctors, and naturopaths all seem to say something different.</p>

    <p>So how do we navigate this chaos? And… do we even need to?</p>

    <p>Going back to our ancestors might be a helpful place to start. Ancient skincare was not about trends – it was about nourishment, ritual and balance. Maybe it still can be.</p>

    <h2>HISTORY: OIL AS A MEDICINE</h2>
    <p>Skincare is not a modern invention – humans have been tending to their skin for millennia:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.kosterina.com/blogs/news/olive-oil-for-skin-a-long-rich-history" target="_blank">Ancient Greece & Rome</a>: Olive oil was used in daily bathing rituals, applied to the skin and then gently scraped off with a strigil.</li>
        <li>Ancient Egypt: Castor, olive, and sesame oil were prized for their moisturizing and healing properties.</li>
        <li>Ayurvedic India: Oil cleansing (abhyanga) was part of daily body care to balance the doshas and promote detoxification.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In all these cultures, plant oils were the foundation – not foaming cleansers or harsh peels.</p>

    <h2>CLEANSING: OIL VS. SURFACTANT</h2>
    <p>We have been taught that in order to clean the skin, we need foam. That squeaky clean feeling? It is not your skin being “pure” – it is your skin barrier being stripped.</p>

    <p>Surfactants do not just remove dirt – they remove your natural oils and disrupt your skin microbiome, which can lead to inflammation, dryness, itching, increased sensitivity or breakouts. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354511184_The_effect_of_Cleansers_on_the_Skin_Microbiome" target="_blank">Read more</a>.</p>

    <h2>WHY OIL WORKS</h2>
    <p>From a physiological view: like dissolves like. Oil dissolves oxidized sebum, sunscreen, makeup, and debris, without stripping the skin. But oil is not just oil – the type matters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</strong><br>
        Best for: dry, inflamed, or sensitive skin<br>
        Rich in oleic acid, vitamin E, polyphenols<br>
        <em>Caution:</em> can feel heavy for some</li>

        <li><strong>Jojoba Oil</strong><br>
        Best for: all skin types, especially oily<br>
        Closest to human sebum, balancing and non-comedogenic<br>
        Long shelf life</li>

        Potent blends of therapeutic botanicals – calming, clarifying, nourishing<br>
        Favorites: sea buckthorn, rose, frankincense</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>HOW TO OIL CLEANSE</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wet a soft cloth or cotton round</li>
        <li>Add 1–2 pumps of oil</li>
        <li>Massage your face slowly, especially around clogged areas</li>
        <li>Wipe away oil and debris</li>
        <li>Repeat if needed (e.g. for SPF or makeup)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>MOISTURISING: KEEP IT SIMPLE</h2>
    <p>Your skin should not feel tight or squeaky after cleansing. If it does, it is crying for balance. A few extra pumps of oil is often all you need. That’s it. No serum stack required.</p>

    <h2>ADJUSTMENT PERIOD</h2>
    <p>Switching to oil cleansing can trigger a short “purge” – breakouts, flakiness or oiliness. This is part of the recalibration process. Your microbiome, lipid layers, and tight junctions are healing. Give it 2–4 weeks.</p>

    <h2>SUN</h2>
    <p>We have gone from sun worship to SPF obsession. A middle path?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Seek shade during midday</li>
        <li>Cover up when needed</li>
        <li>For mild exposure, antioxidant oils like raspberry seed or carrot seed may help <a href="https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1289&context=jscas" target="_blank">[source]</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note:</em> These oils are not a replacement for proper SPF. Use non-nano zinc oxide sunscreens for safe UVA/UVB protection. <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/mineral-vs-chemical-sunscreen" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.</p>

    <h2>BOTTOM LINE</h2>
    <p>A high-quality oil will take you much further than any cleanser + serum combo. Ditch the chemicals, the stripping, the layering – come back to less.</p>
