    <h1>THE MINIMALIST SKINCARE ROUTINE</h1>

    <p>05-01-26</p>

    <p>
      Skincare does not need to be complicated. Your skin already knows how to care for itself.
      Oils have been used for centuries to cleanse and protect the skin. Because oil dissolves oil, it gently removes sebum,
      sunscreen, makeup, and daily buildup without disrupting the skin barrier. Below is a simple, oil-based skincare routine
      focused on minimal intervention.

      <h1>OIL CLEANSING</h1>

      <p>
        Begin by dampening a soft cloth or cotton round with warm water. Apply one to two pumps of oil and gently massage the
        face until makeup and impurities are dissolved. Wipe away the oil with the cloth. The skin should feel clean and
        comfortable — not tight or dry.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>MOISTURISING</h1>

      <p>
        After cleansing, the skin often needs very little additional moisture. One or two extra pumps of oil can be pressed
        into damp skin to support hydration and barrier function.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>MORNING</h1>

      <p>
        Finish your morning routine with a broad-spectrum sunscreen. Even the simplest skincare routine benefits from daily
        sun protection.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>EVENING</h1>

      <p>
        In the evening, if the skin feels dry or compromised, a small amount of castor oil can be applied on top of the
        regular oil. Its thicker texture helps seal in moisture overnight.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>CHOOSING AN OIL</h1>

      <p>
        Jojoba oil closely resembles the natural sebum produced by human skin, making it a good starting point for most skin
        types.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coconut oil is best avoided on the face, as it can be comedogenic for some people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Plant-based oil blends can offer more targeted support, as different plants contain compounds with soothing or
        balancing properties. Brands such as Living Libations
        (<a href="https://dutchhealthstore.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-living-libations-best-skin-ever-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>)
        formulate oils aimed at concerns like acne-prone or sensitive skin.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h1>BOTTOM LINE</h1>

    <p>
      A high-quality oil can often replace multiple products. Reducing friction, stripping, and overuse allows the skin to
      return to its natural balance. In skincare, less is often enough.
