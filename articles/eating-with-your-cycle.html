    <h1>EATING WITH YOUR CYCLE (SEED CYCLING)</h1>
    <p>31-01-2026</p>

    <p>
      The menstrual cycle moves through four distinct phases every month. Hormone levels rise and fall continuously,
      which is why energy, mood, appetite, and focus can feel different from day to day. Some days invite rest, others
      feel more active and outward — largely influenced by estrogen and progesterone.
    </p>

    <p>
      One gentle way to support this natural rhythm is seed cycling. Seed cycling is a food-based practice where
      specific seeds are eaten during different phases of the menstrual cycle. The goal is not to force hormonal
      change, but to support the body with nutrients that align with its natural shifts.
    </p>

    <p>
      This approach is simple, affordable, and easy to integrate into daily meals.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h1>DAYS 1–14 — THE FOLLICULAR PHASE</h1>

      <p>
        During the first half of the cycle, progesterone is low and estrogen gradually rises as the body prepares
        for ovulation.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Add daily:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Flaxseeds contain lignans, plant compounds that support healthy estrogen metabolism. They help the body
        process and excrete estrogen efficiently, supporting balance as estrogen levels rise.

    <section>
      <p>
        Pumpkin seeds are rich in zinc, a mineral involved in ovulation and hormonal signalling. Adequate zinc
        intake supports the processes that lead up to ovulation and prepares the body for the next phase of the cycle.
      </p>

      <p>
        These seeds can be added to yoghurt, oatmeal, smoothies, or salads.

    <section>
      <h1>DAYS 15–28 — THE LUTEAL PHASE</h1>

      <p>
        After ovulation, progesterone becomes the dominant hormone. Estrogen briefly drops and then stabilises at a
        moderate level.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Add daily:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon sunflower seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Sunflower seeds are a natural source of vitamin E, a fat-soluble vitamin that supports normal luteal
        function and overall ovarian health.
      </p>

    <section>
      <p>
        Sesame seeds contain lignans similar to flax, but are emphasized in the luteal phase because they help prevent
        relative estrogen dominance when progesterone should be higher.

    <h1>BOTTOM LINE</h1>

    <p>
      Seed cycling is a simple way to support the menstrual cycle using whole foods. It works best when practiced
      consistently and viewed as nourishment rather than a fix. Small, intentional additions to daily meals can
      support the body as it moves through its natural hormonal rhythm.
