        <h1>CYCLE SYNCING</h1>

        <p>19-11-2025</p>

        <p>
           Listening to your body is something many people struggle with, 
            especially women. For centuries, women lived according to the rhythms 
            of their bodies. Today, however, the pace of modern life—with its 
            expectations of constant productivity—makes it harder to tune in. 
            You feel tired? You still have to get up and do what you are supposed to 
            do. In a fast-moving environment, it is easy to lose touch with our 
            internal signals.
        </p>

        <p>
            How do we reconnect? By understanding our natural cycle—and working 
            with it rather than against it. Below, we break down each phase of 
            the menstrual cycle and offer simple nutrition support to help you feel more aligned.
        </p>

        <!-- MENSTRUATION -->
        <section>
            <h2>MENSTRUATION (Day 1–5)</h2>

            <p>
                This phase is about rest, release and renewal. Energy often dips, cramps may appear,
                and mood can shift.
            </p>

            <p><strong>To support this phase:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Focus on foods rich in <a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/the-impact-of-nutrition-on-menstrual-health-109464.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                        iron, since blood loss can deplete iron stores
                    and contribute to fatigue.
                    <a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/the-impact-of-nutrition-on-menstrual-health-109464.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

                </li>

                <li>
                    Foods rich in <strong>magnesium</strong> help relax the muscles and support mood.

                <li>
                    <strong>Omega-3 fatty acids</strong> may reduce pain and inflammation during this phase.

                <li>Warm, nourishing meals (soups, stews, porridges) bring comfort and support gentle digestion.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Seeds:</strong> flaxseeds and pumpkin seeds — often used in “seed cycling,” a holistic
                nutrition approach that alternates seeds across the menstrual phases to support hormone balance.
                Early studies suggest potential benefits but evidence remains limited.

            <h2>FOLLICULAR PHASE (Day 6–13)</h2>

            <p>
                The body begins to prepare for ovulation. Energy and mood often rise; oestrogen levels steadily climb.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Foods rich in <strong>vitamin D</strong>, <strong>vitamin E</strong> and
                    <strong>β-carotene</strong> support hormonal transition and provide antioxidant protection.

                <li>Fermented foods support gut health—and a healthy gut plays a key role in hormone balance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Seeds:</strong> flaxseeds, pumpkin seeds</p>
            <p>

            <h2>OVULATION (Day 14–16)</h2>

            <p>This is the peak: highest energy, most sociable, the body at its most vibrant.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Foods rich in <strong>vitamin B-complex</strong> and <strong>zinc</strong> support hormonal peaks.
                </li>
                <li>Sweet fruits like figs and berries bring antioxidants and gentle, natural sugars.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The body prepares for pregnancy or the next menstruation. Many women notice fluctuations
                in mood, energy, and digestion.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Complex carbohydrates help stabilise blood sugar and support steadier energy.</li>
                <li>Protein helps maintain muscle, satiety, and balanced blood sugar.</li>
                <li>
                    Cruciferous vegetables support oestrogen metabolism (for example via the liver).

        <!-- BOTTOM LINE -->
        <h1>BOTTOM LINE</h1>

        <p>
            Cycle syncing invites you to move through your month with more softness and awareness.
            It gently shifts the question from “How can I push through?” to “What does my body need right now?”
        </p>

        <p>
            You may notice that some phases invite more movement and connection, while others call for rest,
            grounding foods, and slower mornings. None of this is about strict rules; it is about recognising
            patterns and responding with kindness.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let your cycle be a rhythm you live with—not something you fight against.
            A quiet guide, month after month, reminding you of your own natural balance.
