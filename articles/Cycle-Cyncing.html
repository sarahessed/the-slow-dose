    <h1>CYCLE SYNCING</h1>

    <p>19–11–2025</p>

    <p>
      Listening to your body is something many people struggle with,
      especially women. For centuries, women lived according to the rhythms
      of their bodies. Today, however, the pace of modern life—with its
      expectations of constant productivity—makes it harder to tune in.
    </p>

    <p>
      You feel tired? You still have to get up and do what you are supposed to
      do. In a fast-moving environment, it is easy to lose touch with our
      internal signals.
    </p>

    <p>
      How do we reconnect? By understanding our natural cycle—and working
      with it rather than against it. Below, we break down each phase of
      the menstrual cycle and offer simple nutrition support.
    </p>

    <!-- MENSTRUATION -->
    <section>
      <h2>MENSTRUATION (Day 1–5)</h2>

      <p>
        This phase is about rest, release and renewal. Energy often dips,
        cramps may appear, and mood can shift.
      </p>

      <p><strong>To support this phase:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Focus on foods rich in
          <a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/the-impact-of-nutrition-on-menstrual-health-109464.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iron</a>,
          since blood loss can deplete iron stores.
        </li>

        <li>
          Foods rich in
          <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nutrition-research-reviews/article/nutritional-practices-to-manage-menstrual-cycle-related-symptoms-a-systematic-review/F28E2DC079C7DC2F1AC07A0EFCDE0DE1"
             target="_blank" rel="noopener">magnesium</a>
          help relax muscles and support mood.
        </li>

             target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omega-3 fatty acids</a>
          may reduce pain and inflammation.
        </li>

        <li>
          Warm, nourishing meals (soups, stews, porridges) bring comfort
          and support digestion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Seeds:</strong> flaxseeds and pumpkin seeds.

        though evidence remains limited.

        whole grains, omega-3 rich foods.

          <a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/the-impact-of-nutrition-on-menstrual-health-109464.html"
             target="_blank" rel="noopener">vitamin D, vitamin E and β-carotene</a>
          support hormonal transition.
        </li>

        <li>
          Fermented foods support gut health, which plays a role in
          hormone balance.
        </li>
      </ul>
