    <h2>HEALTH BENEFITS OF GELATIN</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Skin glow:</strong> 
            As collagen declines with age, dryness, wrinkles, and loss of elasticity follow. 
            Supplementation can improve <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5742730/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hydration, firmness, and reduce visible aging</a>. 
            Think of it as beauty care from the inside out.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Collagen boost:</strong> 
            Gelatin not only provides amino acids but also 
            <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31187836/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stimulates your body’s own collagen production</a>. 
            It works as both building block and trigger for repair.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Joint comfort:</strong> 
            Cartilage is collagen-rich. When it wears down, stiffness appears. 
            Gelatin has been shown to 
            <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30368550/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce joint discomfort and improve mobility</a>, especially in athletes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cell protection:</strong> 
            Certain gelatin peptides 
            <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25884286/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">act as antioxidants</a>, neutralizing free radicals that damage cells and speed aging.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Gut support:</strong> 
            Rich in glycine, gelatin may 
            <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28174772/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strengthen the intestinal lining</a>, reduce “leaky gut”, and soothe sensitive digestion.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bone strength:</strong> 
            Bones aren’t just minerals – they are protein too. 
            Gelatin supplementation can 
            <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5793325/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support bone density and formation</a>.
