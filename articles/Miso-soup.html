        <h1>MISO SOUP</h1>

        <p>Miso soup is more than a dish – it is part of Japanese daily life. Traditionally served with rice, it appears at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Each family often has their own style, influenced by regional miso varieties (white, red, or mixed) and local ingredients. What looks like a simple bowl of soup is actually a reflection of balance and nourishment at the heart of Japanese food culture.</p>

            <h2>HEALTH BENEFITS</h2>
            <p>Miso is a fermented soybean paste, rich in probiotics, minerals, and proteins. Regular consumption has been linked to <a href="https://www.tsubisoup.com/blog/7-health-benefits-of-miso-soup-you-need-to-know" target="_blank">improved digestion, a stronger gut microbiome, and cardiovascular benefits</a>.
            <ul>
                <li>Fermentation power – Probiotics in miso may support gut health.</li>
                <li>Mineral boost – Miso provides manganese, copper, zinc, and vitamin K.</li>
                <li>Heart health – <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/internalmedicine/56/1/56_56.7538/_article/-char/ja/" target="_blank">One study</a> found that miso soup consumption can help lower heart rate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The only consideration: miso soup is relatively high in sodium. For most healthy individuals, this is balanced out by its nutrient density, but it is worth noting if you are monitoring your salt intake.

            <h2>RECIPE</h2>
            <p>The base of miso soup is dashi – a delicate broth. You can buy it ready-made in Asian supermarkets, but making your own is simple and often gives a fresher taste.</p>
            <p><strong>Homemade dashi (makes ~2 bowls):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 dried shiitake mushroom</li>
                <li>1 strip of kombu (umami-rich kelp)</li>
                <li>300 mL water</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak the shiitake and kombu in the water for at least 12–24 hours in the fridge.</li>
                <li>Strain out the solids and gently heat the broth. Avoid boiling – this keeps the flavours clean.</li>
                <li>Add a handful of wakame (instant seaweed) and let it soften.</li>
                <li>Stir in 1 tablespoon miso. Best method: place the miso in a small strainer, dip it into the hot broth, and dissolve by stirring. This keeps the soup smooth.</li>
                <li>Return the shiitake (sliced) to the broth. Optional additions: cubes of silken tofu, sliced spring onion, or a splash of tamari soy sauce for depth.</li>
            </ol>
