    <h1>FUNCTIONAL FOODS PT 2</h1>

    <p>04-02-26</p>

    <p>
      food holds superpower. each ingredient contributes not only to taste, but also to a specific function in the body.
      from supporting biological processes to improving overall health, functional foods can be simple, everyday additions
      to your routine.
    </p>

    <p>
      below is a selection of functional foods and how they can be practically incorporated into daily life.
    </p>

      <h1>EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</h1>

      <p>
        extra virgin olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats and powerful polyphenols, bioactive plant compounds that
        help protect cells from oxidative stress and inflammation. regular olive oil consumption is associated with
        improved cardiovascular health, better metabolic function, and a lower risk of chronic disease.
      </p>

      <p>
        an easy way to incorporate olive oil into your daily routine is by taking a small shot on an empty stomach in
        the morning. this gently stimulates digestion while providing the body with stable, anti-inflammatory fats.
        always choose organic, extra virgin olive oil to ensure the highest polyphenol content and to avoid pesticide
        residues.

      <h1>OREGANO OIL</h1>

      <p>
        oregano oil is a highly concentrated extract of the oregano plant and is known for its strong antimicrobial,
        antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. it has traditionally been used to support digestive health,
        balance yeast and bacteria in the gut, and help with skin conditions such as acne.
      </p>

      <p>
        because oregano oil is very potent, it should always be diluted before consumption. a simple method is to add a
        few drops to a spoonful or small shot of olive oil. taken occasionally, this can support gut balance and immune
        defense without overwhelming the system.

      <h1>APPLE CIDER VINEGAR</h1>

      <p>
        apple cider vinegar (acv) has been used for centuries as a digestive tonic. its main active component, acetic
        acid, has been shown to help moderate blood sugar spikes after meals and improve insulin sensitivity.
      </p>

      <p>
        unfiltered acv contains “the mother”, the cloudy culture of bacteria and yeast that forms during fermentation.
        this indicates a minimally processed product with active compounds still intact. to use acv, dilute one
        tablespoon in a glass of water and drink it about 20–30 minutes before a meal. using a straw helps protect tooth
        enamel from acidity.

      <h1>CAYENNE PEPPER</h1>

      <p>
        cayenne pepper contains capsaicin, the compound responsible for its heat. capsaicin stimulates nerve endings in
        the stomach lining, which in turn increases the secretion of digestive enzymes and gastric juices. this can help
        improve digestion, reduce bloating, and support nutrient absorption.
      </p>

      <p>
        a small pinch of cayenne can be added to your apple cider vinegar drink or to warm water. because it is powerful,
        only a very small amount is needed to activate its digestive benefits.

      <h1>CELTIC SEA SALT</h1>

      <p>
        celtic sea salt is a minimally refined salt that contains trace minerals such as magnesium, potassium, and
        calcium. these minerals act as electrolytes, helping the body absorb and retain water inside the cells.
      </p>

      <p>
        placing a few grains of celtic sea salt under the tongue before drinking water can help improve hydration,
        especially after waking up or during physical stress. electrolytes allow water to move into cells more
        efficiently, preventing dehydration and supporting nerve and muscle function.

      <h1>PEPPERMINT TEA</h1>

      <p>
        peppermint tea is a classic digestive herb. it relaxes the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, which
        helps reduce cramping, bloating, and gas. peppermint also has mild antimicrobial effects, which may support skin
        health and gut balance.
      </p>

      <p>
        to make peppermint tea effective, steep the leaves in hot water for at least five minutes. this allows the
        essential oils, where most of the active compounds are stored, to fully release into the tea.

    <h1>BOTTOM LINE</h1>

    <p>
      functional foods are not about extremes or miracle cures. they are about small, intentional rituals that gently
      support the body over time. when used consistently, these simple ingredients can improve digestion, stabilize
      energy, and support long-term health, without replacing the foundation of a balanced, nourishing diet.
