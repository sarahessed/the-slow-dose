    <h1>FUNCTIONAL FOODS</h1>

    <p>27-12-25</p>

    <p>
      Food holds superpower. Each ingredient contributes not only to taste, but also to a specific function in the body.
      From supporting biological processes to improving overall health, functional foods can be simple, everyday additions
      to your routine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below is a selection of functional foods and how they can be practically incorporated into daily life.
    </p>

      <h1>CLOVES</h1>

      <p>
        Cloves are rich in antioxidants and contain important micronutrients such as manganese. They have antimicrobial
        properties and may help regulate blood sugar levels. In traditional medicine, cloves have long been used to
        support digestion.
      </p>

      <p>
        An easy way to include cloves in your routine is by soaking three whole cloves in water overnight. This allows
        for slow extraction of their active compounds. The water can be sipped throughout the day.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>SARDINES</h1>

      <p>
        Sardines are extremely nutrient-dense. They provide high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, complete protein,
        calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12 — making them a strong alternative to supplements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another advantage is that sardines are typically wild-caught rather than farmed. When choosing canned sardines,
        opt for those packed in water. Sardines packed in oil often use low-quality oils, and discarding the oil also
        means losing some fat-soluble omega-3s.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>GHEE</h1>

      <p>
        Ghee is a clarified butter that is naturally lactose-free and rich in fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. For
        those avoiding lactose, ghee is an efficient way to obtain these essential nutrients.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is also well-suited for cooking, as its high smoke point makes it more stable at higher temperatures compared
        to regular butter.
      </p>

      <h1>BRAZIL NUTS</h1>

      <p>
        Brazil nuts are one of the richest natural sources of selenium, an essential mineral that supports thyroid
        function and immune health. Just one to two brazil nuts per day is sufficient to meet selenium needs, making
        them an effective food-based alternative to supplementation.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>BUCKWHEAT</h1>

      <p>
        Although often grouped with grains, buckwheat is a pseudocereal and naturally gluten-free. It is rich in minerals
        such as manganese, copper, magnesium, iron, and phosphorus, and contains a high amount of fiber.
      </p>

      <p>
        Buckwheat works well as a warm porridge, but can also be used to make crunchy granola or added to salads for
        texture.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>FERMENTED FOODS</h1>

      <p>
        Fermented foods introduce beneficial bacteria to the gut microbiome, supporting digestion and immune function.
        The gut can be seen as a complex ecosystem — much like a forest — housing trillions of microorganisms that
        communicate, compete, and work together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as biodiversity is essential for a healthy ecosystem, dietary diversity is key for a resilient microbiome.
        Regularly consuming fermented foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, or yogurt helps nourish this internal
        system and supports long-term gut health.
      </p>

    <h1>BOTTOM LINE</h1>

    <p>
      Functional foods are not about perfection or superfoods, but about variety and consistency. Small, intentional
      choices made daily can support the body in powerful ways — especially when they complement, rather than replace, a
      balanced diet.
