    <h1>A SIMPLE DAILY SUPPLEMENT ROUTINE</h1>

    <p>09-01-26</p>

    <p>
      Eating a varied, whole-food diet provides most of the nutrients the body needs. Still, modern life, dietary
      preferences, stress, and environmental factors can make it difficult to meet every requirement consistently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Supplementation is not about replacing food, but about bridging specific gaps when needed. The key is intention:
      choosing supplements based on individual needs rather than trends.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below is what I personally include in my daily routine, and why.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h1>OMEGA-3 FISH OIL</h1>

      <p>
        Omega-3 fatty acids are naturally found in fatty fish, grass-fed meat, flaxseeds, walnuts, and algae. They
        support heart health, brain function, inflammation regulation, and hormone signalling. When dietary intake is
        low — for example when fish is eaten rarely or not at all — supplementation can be useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quality matters here. Omega-3 oils can oxidise easily, which is why freshness is important. I look for a low
        TOTOX value, a clean and well-sourced oil, and the presence of both EPA and DHA. Algae oil is a good plant-based
        alternative, but it often contains mainly DHA. EPA is equally relevant, especially for inflammation and
        hormone-related processes.

    <section>
      <h1>VITAMIN D3 + K2</h1>

      <p>
        Living far from the equator means sunlight exposure is limited for much of the year. As a result, vitamin D
        deficiency is common. Vitamin D3 supports calcium absorption from the diet and plays a role in immune function,
        muscle strength, and bone health.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vitamin K2 complements this by activating proteins that help guide calcium into bones and teeth, rather than
        allowing it to accumulate elsewhere in the body. For this reason, D3 and K2 are best taken together.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>MAGNESIUM BISGLYCINATE</h1>

      <p>
        Magnesium is involved in hundreds of biochemical reactions, including those related to muscle contraction, nerve
        signalling, and energy production. Magnesium bisglycinate is a chelated form, meaning the mineral is bound to
        the amino acid glycine. This improves absorption and tends to be gentler on digestion.
      </p>

      <p>
        I notice magnesium is most supportive when training frequently, feeling tense, or sleeping lightly. It can help
        with muscle function, reduce cramping, and support a calmer nervous system.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>ZINC</h1>

      <p>
        Zinc supports immune cell function, wound healing, and skin integrity (acne). It also plays a role in hormone
        signalling. Even mild deficiencies can show up subtly — especially during periods of stress, heavy training, or
        irregular cycles. For me, zinc is one of those “small but noticeable” minerals when I am consistent with it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>VITAMIN B6</h1>

      <p>
        Vitamin B6 is involved in the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, which is why it is
        often linked to mood support. It also influences hormone balance through prolactin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prolactin is best known as a breastfeeding hormone, but it is present in everyone. When prolactin is even
        slightly elevated, it can interfere with the luteal phase — the second half of the cycle after ovulation — where
        progesterone should be most active. This does not always mean progesterone is “low,” but it can mean progesterone
        feels less effective in the body.
      </p>

      <p>
        By supporting dopamine and lowering prolactin, B6 helps the progesterone you already produce exert its
        stabilising effects more smoothly. This can be especially relevant for symptoms like luteal-phase anxiety,
        breast tenderness, bloating, or mood swings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>VITEX AGNUS</h1>

      <p>
        Vitex works at a different level. Rather than acting directly on the ovaries, it influences the pituitary gland
        in the brain. Compounds in vitex stimulate dopamine D2 receptors. Dopamine acts as a natural brake on prolactin
        release, so supporting this pathway can reduce prolactin over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        When prolactin is lower, the body often finds it easier to maintain a steady rhythm after ovulation, which can
        support more stable progesterone production and a more regular cycle overall.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h1>BOTTOM LINE</h1>

    <p>
      These supplements are not meant to control or override the body, but to gently support its existing systems. I see
      omega-3, vitamin D, and magnesium as foundational, and I use B6 and vitex more intentionally when I want extra
      support for cycle regularity and luteal-phase symptoms. As with food, consistency and awareness tend to matter more
      than perfection.
